This is a simple flutter chat app I made using socketIO for Windows
I used javascript for backend sever
I used a mySQL database to store user data and messages using XAMPP's phpmyadmin

If you have issues running the project, try deleting the cmake cache file
Make sure to configure your database beforehand, change the mySQL connection parameters and to change the IP address to your own IP address
